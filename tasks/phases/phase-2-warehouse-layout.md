# 🏗️ **Phase 2: Warehouse Layout & Grid System**

**Phase:** 2 of 11  
**Goal:** Implement 25x20 warehouse grid with snake-pattern layout  
**Deliverable:** Warehouse layout manager with grid coordinates and bounds  
**Success Criteria:** Grid system generates valid coordinates and enforces warehouse bounds

---

## 📋 **Phase 2 Requirements Summary**

Based on clarifying questions, this phase will implement:

### **Grid Coordinate System**
- 1-based coordinate system (Aisle 1-25, Rack 1-20)
- Coordinate representation as tuples `(aisle, rack)`
- Coordinate bounds validation (1 ≤ aisle ≤ 25, 1 ≤ rack ≤ 20)
- Never generate invalid coordinates - orders come within designated coordinates only

### **Snake Pattern Navigation**
- Bidirectional snake pattern based on robot direction
- Forward direction: odd aisles left→right, even aisles right→left
- Reverse direction: odd aisles right→left, even aisles left→right
- Direction calculation based on robot movement
- Path optimization for shortest distance

### **Special Zones & Packout**
- Packout location at coordinate (1, 1) as special zone
- No item pickup at packout location
- Robot starts and returns all items to packout
- Distance tracking for KPI calculations

### **Integration Requirements**
- Single warehouse instance (singleton pattern)
- Integration with existing SimulationEngine and EventSystem
- Grid visualization utilities for debugging
- Comprehensive testing with boundary conditions
