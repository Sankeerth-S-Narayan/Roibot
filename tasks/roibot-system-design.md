# ü§ñ E-Commerce Warehouse Robot Simulation - System Design Document

**Version:** 1.2
**Date:** July 8, 2025
**Project Type:** Single Robot Warehouse Simulation with Bidirectional Snake Path Navigation

---

## üìå Project Overview

### üåü Primary Goal

Build a real-time simulation of a warehouse robot system for e-commerce fulfillment using synthetic data generation and performance analytics. This simulation replicates the movement and order fulfillment behavior of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) in a 25x20 warehouse grid, using an optimized bidirectional snake path strategy.

### üè¢ Business Context

* **Target Environment:** Large-scale e-commerce warehouse
* **Scale:** 25 aisles √ó 20 racks (500 total storage locations)
* **Order Rate:** New order generated every 20 seconds
* **Robot Fleet:** Single robot (Phase 1); scalable for multi-robot environments
* **Objective:** Generate high-fidelity data for algorithm testing and operational improvements

## üìÅ Data Models

### üìÖ Order Queue Entity (Active Orders)

```python
{
  "order_id": "ORD_20250708_001",
  "item_ids": ["ITEM_A1", "ITEM_B3", "ITEM_C7"],
  "timestamp_received": "2025-07-08T14:50:00Z",
  "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
  "assigned_robot_id": "ROBOT_001"
}
```

### üïõ Completed Orders Entity

```python
{
  "order_id": "ORD_20250708_001",
  "timestamp_completed": "2025-07-08T14:52:45Z",
  "total_distance_traveled": 450.5,
  "efficiency_score": 0.85,
  "direction_changes": 2,
  "path_optimization_savings": 125.3
  "Total time taken": 34
}
```

### üß∑ Robot Entity

```python
{
  "robot_id": "ROBOT_001",
  "current_position": {"aisle": 12, "rack": 8},
  "target_location": {"aisle": 10, "rack": 15},
  "movement_direction": "REVERSE",

## üîÑ Dynamic Workflow

### 1. Continuous Order Assignment

* Robot status monitored
* Auto-assign next order if IDLE
* Order directly transitions to IN\_PROGRESS
* No idle time between orders

### 2. Bidirectional Snake Path Navigation

* Direction chosen based on shortest path
* Maintains snake-pattern integrity
* Forward/reverse transitions optimized per item position

### 3. Real-Time Inventory Management

* Inventory updated atomically upon order completion
* Prevents overselling
